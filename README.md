Quarantine Party Games: QuackHouse

## Heading ##
  > Can't meet with friends in person during quarantine? This app allows you to play party games with friends over group Zoom calls!

## Sub-Heading ##
  > The Game of Things, Minesweeper, Trivia, and more!

## Summary ##
  > Welcome to the QuackHouse, where you can find an assortment of party games to make use of during quarantine. I have created have "The Game of Things", trivia (you can choose between easy, medium, or hard), minesweeper, and I am in the process of forming DIY trivia where you and your friends can manually create your own trivia questions to add a personalized touch to Trivia Night.

## Problem ##
  > Many people -- especially people who live alone -- are experiencing a decline in their mental health as a result of social isolation. Texting, talking on the phone, and communicating via social media are just not cutting it. While hanging out in Zoom chatting and maybe drinking some beer and eating pizza with friends can be fun, once you get too many friends in the Zoom room and people are trying to have side conversations while other members are chatting amongst themselves, it can get rather loud and hard to hear any one person.

## Solution ##
  > Using the QuackHouse Quarantine Games app is a way to host Zoom social gatherings of any size in a more organized fashion. The great part of using Zoom is interactive; each attendee can take turns sharing the screen so that everyone gets a change to play their part in every game.

  ## Customer Quote ##
  > "You see, I live and work alone so my whole weeks consists of zero in-person interactions. Although I always looked forward to Saturday Zoom meetups with my friend group, it was rather frustrating when say, somebody said something interesting and I wanted to start a side conversation, but of course since several other side-conversation-attempts were happening at the same time. Now that we have an app made specifically for friend and family zoom calls, we can turn to some fun organized games when the conversation situation becomes a bit crazy! All thanks to QuackHouse Quarantine Party Games'!"

## Quote from You ##
  >"'QuackHouse Quarantine Games' is just one of many ways to pass the time with friends when the cabin fever really starts to kick in. Just like everybody else, I recently started noticing that hanging out with friends and family as a large group online was simply not the same as meeting in person. As a result I decided to make an app that would let groups of friends add a little 'something else' to their social hangouts.
